Intro
=====

`YANG (RFC6020) <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6020>`_ is a data modelling language, it's a way of defining how data is supposed to look like. The `napalm-yang <https://github.com/napalm-automation/napalm-yang>`_ library provides a framework to use models defined with YANG in the context of network management. It provides mechanisms to transform native data/config into YANG and vice versa.

You can take a look to the following `tutorial <https://github.com/napalm-automation/napalm-yang/blob/develop/interactive_demo/tutorial.ipynb>`_ to see what this is about and how to get started.
